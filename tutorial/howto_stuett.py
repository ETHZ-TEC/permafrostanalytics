import stuett
# What is stuett?
# A data management package developed for analysing and visualizing outdoor sensor deployments
# The name originates from the lower german word "st√ºtt" which means "support"
# The tool revolves around a feedback workflow where analysis is tighly integrated with multi-modal input

import argparse
from pathlib import Path
from datetime import datetime

parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description="How to stuett")
parser.add_argument(
    "-p",
    "--path",
    type=str,
    default=str(Path(__file__).absolute().parent.joinpath("..", "data/")),
    help="The path to the folder containing the permafrost hackathon data",
)

# First load our data. In this case rock temperature data

# In stuett we can choose from different data loaders. Here, we choose the csv loader
# First we instantiate our loader with the data file. It will not load the file immediately but instead create a node
rock_temperature_node = stuett.data.CsvSource(rock_temperature_file)

#### Data loading ####
# There are multiple ways to load the data.
# 1. When nothing is given as an argument to the node it will load all data available.
rock_temperature = rock_temperature_node()

# 2. We can also select a time frame providing a request (a dict containing e.g. start_time and end_time).
# Note: Since we are loading csv files the whole file will still be loaded but then cropped to the desired time frame.
#       Other nodes, e.g. seismic nodes, will only load the data from the specified period
rock_temperature = rock_temperature_node(
    {"start_time": "2017-08-01", "end_time": "2017-09-01"}
)

# 3. If we want to provide the same data for every call but do not want to send a request each time we can simply
# configure the node with a request on initialization
rock_temperature_node = stuett.data.CsvSource(
    **{
        "filename": rock_temperature_file,
        "start_time": "2017-08-01",
        "end_time": "2017-09-01",
    }
)
rock_temperature = rock_temperature_node()

#### Data structure ####
# The stuett nodes (unless specifically configured differently) will return xarray DataArrays.
# The DataArrays give you additional information e.g. regarding time or units.
print(rock_temperature)

# DataArrays provide you with advanced indexing capabilities
# For more information see http://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/indexing.html

# Time indexing: The following three lines accomplish the same goal.
one_day = rock_temperature.sel(time=(slice(datetime(2017, 8, 1), datetime(2017, 8, 2))))
one_day = rock_temperature.loc[datetime(2017, 8, 1) : datetime(2017, 8, 2)]
one_day = rock_temperature.loc["2017-08-01":"2017-08-02"]
print(one_day)

# Since the rock temperature sensor gives us the temperature for different depths
# We would like to select one specific depth (i.e. one specific column from the data)
one_day_5cm = rock_temperature.sel(
    time=slice(datetime(2017, 8, 1), datetime(2017, 8, 2)), name="temperature_5cm"
)
one_day_5cm = rock_temperature.loc["2017-08-01":"2017-08-02", "temperature_5cm"]
print(one_day_5cm)
# or from multiple depths
one_day_5cm_10cm = rock_temperature.loc[
    "2017-08-01":"2017-08-02", ["temperature_5cm", "temperature_10cm"]
]
print(one_day_5cm_10cm)

#### Data formats ####
# Note: The timezone used within stuett is UTC, but the datetime objects you receive are not timezone aware.
#       Timezone issues are a recurring problem so be careful when working with the data.
