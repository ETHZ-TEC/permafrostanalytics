Create train_data and test_data folders with 
0,1,2 subfolders respectively (according to number of classes)
TODO: automatize this step 

Open create_labels.ipynb and adjust the paths accordingly
Run the entire notebook for multiple years consecutively
with YEAR_FLAG = 'train' and one year with YEAR_FLAG = 'test'
to generate the data in the test folder

Open lw_classifier.ipynb and adjust train_data and test_data
paths. (Optional) inspect a couple of samples from dataloaders
as sanity check. Run the rest of the cells to start the training.
