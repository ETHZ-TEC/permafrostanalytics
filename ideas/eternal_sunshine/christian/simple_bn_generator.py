This file has been copied and modified from another project of mine in
order to be used for the purpose of this hackathon. Specifically, we use it to
generatoe the batchnorm weights of a resnet.

Implementation of a hypernet, that outputs weights for a main network.

This hypernetwork is implemented such that it can be cascaded (i.e., a
hypernetwork can produce the weights of another instance of a hypernetwork).
Note, if one wants to enrich this implementation by adding spectral
normalization (which can only be used for a hypernetwork that has trainable
weights), one would have to prodvide two distinct implementations:

    - `no_weights` is True: No spectral normalization is used and the
      hypernetwork can be implemented as shown here.
    - "no_weights" is False and spectral normalization is used:
      The hypernetwork needs consist of a set of modules rather than a set of
      parameters of modules (which can then passed to methods from
      nn.functional). E.g., in the constructor of the linear hypernetwork we
      have to create instances of nn.Linear:
      :code:`nn.utils.spectral_norm(nn.Linear(n, m))`
      Though, if one wants to keep the possibility of easily adding parameters
      (see argument "dTheta" of forward method), one should continue using the
      methods provided in nn.functional and instead find a way to wrap
      parameters inside modules that fulfill no other purpose.

        and a dedicated output layer for each weight matrix/bias vector.

        The input to the network will be a learned task embedding.

        Args:
            target_shapes: A list of list of integers, denoting the shape of
                each parameter tensor in the main network (hence, determining
                the output of this network).
            num_tasks: The number of task embeddings needed.
            layers: A list of integers, each indicating the size of a hidden
                    layer in this network.
            te_dim: The dimensionality of the task embeddings.
            no_te_embs: If this option is True, no class internal task
                embeddings are constructed and are instead expected to be
                provided to the forward method.
            activation_fn: The nonlinearity used in hidden layers. If None, no
                nonlinearity will be applied.
            use_bias: Whether layers may have bias terms.
            no_weights: If set to True, no trainable parameters will be
                constructed, i.e., weights are assumed to be produced ad-hoc
                by a hypernetwork and passed to the forward function.
                Does not affect task embeddings.
            init_weights (optional): This option is for convenience reasons.
                The option expects a list of parameter values that are used to
                initialize the network weights. As such, it provides a
                convenient way of initializing a network with, for instance, a
                weight draw produced by the hypernetwork.
                Does not affect task embeddings.
            ce_dim (optional): The dimensionality of any additional embeddings,
                (in addition to the task embedding) that will be used as input
                to the hypernetwork. If this option is None, no additional input
                is expected. Otherwise, an additional embedding has to be passed
                to the forward function.
                A typical usecase would be a chunk embedding.
            dropout_rate (optional): If -1, no dropout will be applied.
                Otherwise a number between 0 and 1 is expected, denoting the
                dropout of hidden layers.
            use_spectral_norm: Enable spectral normalization for all layers.
            use_batch_norm: If True, batchnorm will be applied to all hidden
                layers.
            noise_dim (optional): If -1, no noise will be applied.
                Otherwise the hypernetwork will receive as additional input
                zero-mean Gaussian noise with unit variance during training
                (zeroes will be inputted during eval-mode). Note, if a batch of
                inputs is given, then a different noise vector is generated for
                every sample in the batch.
            temb_std (optional): If not -1, the task embeddings will be
                perturbed by zero-mean Gaussian noise with the given std
                (additive noise). The perturbation is only applied if the
                network is in training mode. Note, per batch of external inputs,
                the perturbation of the task embedding will be shared.
