# Idea: Classifier for Images and Seimsic Data


## Quickstart
To train the image classifier, execute from the repositories base directory:
```
python ideas/machine_learning/classification.py --classifier image
```

or
```
python ideas/machine_learning/classification.py --classifier seismic
```



## What next?
* We need other labels! Other noise sources than mountaineers influence our system. We would like to reduce as many as possible.
* More fine-grained predictions, bounding boxes, region-based methods. A lot more can be done.
* Correlation of images with other sources, such as weather or temperature. Snow/temperature relation and much more.
